## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ and npm
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Redis 6+ (for background jobs)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Taskosaur/taskosaur.git
   cd taskosaur
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**

   Run the interactive setup command to create your environment configuration:

   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

   This will create a single `.env` file with guided configuration for:

   - **Global Configuration**: App host and port settings
   - **Backend Configuration**: Database, authentication, Redis, email, and file upload settings
   - **Frontend Configuration**: API base URL and organization settings

   After setup, you'll need to manually run:

   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm run be:install && npm run fe:install

   # Setup database
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run db:seed core
   ```

3. **Manual Setup (Alternative)**

   If you prefer manual configuration, create a single environment file in the root directory:

   **Root Environment** (`.env`):

   ```env
   # Global/Proxy Configuration
   APP_HOST=127.0.0.1
   APP_PORT=9123

   #### Backend Configuration >>>>>
   BE_UNIX_SOCKET=1
   # BE_HOST=127.0.0.1  # Use when BE_UNIX_SOCKET=0
   # BE_PORT=9102       # Use when BE_UNIX_SOCKET=0

   BE_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your-db-username:your-db-password@localhost:5432/taskosaur"

   # Authentication
   BE_JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret-key-change-this"
   BE_JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="your-refresh-secret-key-change-this-too"
   BE_JWT_EXPIRES_IN="15m"
   BE_JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN="7d"

   # Redis Configuration (for Bull Queue)
   BE_REDIS_HOST=localhost
   BE_REDIS_PORT=6379
   BE_REDIS_PASSWORD=

   # Email Configuration (for notifications)
   BE_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   BE_SMTP_PORT=587
   BE_SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   BE_SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
   BE_SMTP_FROM=noreply@taskosaur.com

   # Frontend URL (for email links)
   BE_FRONTEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9123

   # File Upload
   BE_UPLOAD_DEST="./uploads"
   BE_MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760

   # Queue Configuration
   BE_MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=5
   BE_JOB_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
   #### Backend Configuration <<<<<

   #### Frontend Configuration >>>>>
   FE_UNIX_SOCKET=1
   # FE_HOST=127.0.0.1  # Use when FE_UNIX_SOCKET=0
   # FE_PORT=9101       # Use when FE_UNIX_SOCKET=0

   FE_NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=/api
   FE_NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID=your-default-organization-id-here
   #### Frontend Configuration <<<<<
   ```

   Then install dependencies and setup database:

   ```bash
   # Install dependencies (run from root directory)
   npm install
   npm run be:install         # Install backend dependencies
   npm run fe:install         # Install frontend dependencies

   # Setup database
   npm run db:migrate         # Run database migrations
   npm run db:seed:admin            # Seed the database with admin data
   npm run db:seed core            # Seed the database with core data
   ```

4. **Start the Application**

   ```bash
   # Development mode (with hot reload)
   npm run start:dev

   # Production mode
   npm start
   ```

5. **Access the Application**
   - Application: [http://127.0.0.1:9123](http://127.0.0.1:9123) (or your configured host/port)

## FAQ

### AI & Features Questions

**Q: How does Taskosaur's AI Mode work?**
A: Unlike basic AI chatbots, Taskosaur's AI Mode is a complete Project Manager Assistant. It uses advanced browser automation to actually perform actions - navigating interfaces, filling forms, creating tasks, updating statuses, and executing complex workflows. It combines natural language understanding with real automation capabilities to act as your personal project manager.

**Q: What makes this different from other AI project management tools?**
A: Taskosaur is the world's first **AI Mode** project management tool. While other tools offer AI chat for suggestions, Taskosaur's AI actually executes tasks, automates workflows, and manages projects end-to-end through natural conversation. It's the difference between AI advice and AI action.

**Q: How do I enable AI Mode?**
A: Go to Organization Settings → AI Assistant Settings, toggle "Enable AI Chat" to ON, and add your LLM API key from any compatible provider (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, or local AI). The AI chat panel (sparkles icon) will appear, ready to manage your projects conversationally.

**Q: What can I accomplish with AI Mode?**
A: Virtually everything! Set up complete project hierarchies, automate task assignments, bulk update hundreds of items, create complex workflows, generate reports, analyze team performance, migrate data between projects - all through natural language commands.

**Q: Does the AI require internet connection?**
A: Taskosaur supports both cloud AI providers (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic) and local AI models (Ollama, etc.). For complete privacy, run open-source models locally. The AI Mode automation works entirely within your browser.

**Q: Is my data secure with AI Mode?**
A: Absolutely. All AI interactions happen within your self-hosted Taskosaur instance. Your project data, conversations, and API keys stay completely private. The AI only sees what you choose to share through the chat interface.

### General Questions

**Q: Is Taskosaur free to use?**
A: Yes! Taskosaur is available under the Business Source License and free for non-production use and internal production use within organizations.

**Q: Can I use Taskosaur for commercial projects?**
A: Yes, you can use Taskosaur for production purposes as long as you don't offer it to third parties as a competitive hosting service or embedded product. Internal use within your organization is permitted. After 4 years, it becomes MPL 2.0 licensed.

**Q: How does Taskosaur compare to Jira/Monday.com/Asana?**
A: Taskosaur provides equivalent core functionality but with a revolutionary advantage: the world's first AI Mode that actually executes project management tasks through conversation. While traditional tools require manual navigation and complex workflows, Taskosaur's AI Mode handles everything from project setup to team coordination through natural language. Plus, you get complete data ownership, no subscription fees, full source code access, and self-hosting capability. It's like having Jira's power with an expert Project Manager Assistant built-in.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What databases are supported?**
A: Currently PostgreSQL 13+. We plan to add MySQL support in future releases.

**Q: Can I deploy Taskosaur on my own servers?**
A: Yes! Taskosaur is designed for self-hosting with Docker or manual deployment on any server.

**Q: Is there a mobile app?**
A: A mobile app is planned for Phase 2 (Q3 2025). The web app is mobile-responsive in the meantime.

**Q: How do I backup my data?**
A: Use `pg_dump` for PostgreSQL backups and backup your uploaded files from the `uploads/` directory.

### Development Questions

**Q: How can I contribute?**
A: Check our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup and contribution guidelines.

**Q: Can I create custom plugins?**
A: Plugin system is planned for Phase 4 (2026). Currently, you can modify the source code directly.

**Q: How do I add custom fields?**
A: Custom fields are being implemented and will be available through the admin interface. See the documentation for current implementation status.

### Deployment Questions

**Q: What hosting providers work best?**
A: We recommend Railway, Render, or DigitalOcean for backend, and Vercel or Netlify for frontend.

**Q: How many users can Taskosaur support?**
A: This depends on your server resources. The architecture is designed to handle hundreds of concurrent users with proper scaling.

**Q: Is there enterprise support available?**
A: Community support is available through GitHub. Enterprise support options are being planned.
